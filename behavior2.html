        </h1> Animal Behavior
        <p>
            Otters are playful animals and appear to engage in various behaviors for sheer enjoyment, such as making waterslides and then sliding on them into the water. They may also find and play with small stones. Different species vary in their social structure, with some being largely solitary, while others live in groups â€“ in a few species, these groups may be fairly large. These groups will spend about 11%-48% of their day grooming themselves and other otters.
            Otters are predators, which means they hunt down their meals, often consisting of fish, shellfish, and other tasty water snacks.
            When protecting themselves from predators, Otters will flee by swimming away, hiding in kelp beds, or escaping onto dry land.
            Otters are generally active at night, though some species are more active throughout the day. When sleeping, Fresh water otters will sleep on land, whereas their saltier counterparts will float on their backs, usually in a kelp bed, and sleep at the surface of the water.
